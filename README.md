# Frutavision (classifying fruit)

*Alex Jurado*


## Content

Two notebooks performing computer vision, on the first one ('Workbook without augmentation'), the data is retrived from the kaggle api and saved into folders where its split into training and validation using the keras 'ImageDataGenerator' from preprocessing. 

The second notebook, follows the same steps as the first one, but with data augmentation to see if our already powerfull model could perform better.


## Working on: 

Project finished, this was practice towards the tensor flow certification. So a set of strict steps were followed focusing mostly on modelling and not data exploration.
